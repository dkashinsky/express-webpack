# Express Webpack Boilerplate

this project is a small boilerplate for legacy node.js application (node v6) which works as a reminder on how to configure express server which handles static files and transpiles ts code on the fly via webpack and middleware

## Setup

 - make sure you have `nvm` installed
 - run `nvm install` from project root to install node v6
 - run `npm install` from project root to install dependencies

## Development

 - run `npm run start` from project root to start server
 - open `http://localhost:3000` to see demo app
 - edit `greet.ts` file under `src` folder
 - see terminal output as it automatically recompiles on file changes
 - refresh browser to see actual changes

## ToDo
 
 - configure livereload
